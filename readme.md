## How to run the code 


## Setup
Make sure that you have the following repos downloaded, and that the their path is known to matlab
1. MSS
2. PlatEMO 

Step 1:
Move the files that lies in file4PlatEMO into PlatEMO
'Problems' files to under problem
'Algorithm' files to under NSGAII (small changes to the files)

Step 2: 
Go into the multiobjectiveSearch.m folder

Choose: 
Which
- ship
- search method
- number of experiments 

Step 3: 
Check that the it saves to is correct. 
This might need to adjusted in the pathEvaluation files, but you only need to change the "basepath" variable to suit your path

Step 4:
run the file multiobjectiveSearch.m

Step 5: 
Load the results
Each generation and experiments is saved to a path.
